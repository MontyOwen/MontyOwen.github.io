            A long term hobby of mine has been photography. 
            I started shooting photos when I was 16 using my iphone, uploading to instrgram and VSCO. I then moved to using a digital camera, and when i was 24 bought my first film camera (Canon AE1). I prefer shooting on film because it feels more raw. The shots matter more so you have to pick moments, instead of burst shooting with a digital camera, where there is little meaning or attachment to the images that are taken.
            I enjoy taking photos of my friends, random street signs I come across and a variety of other things.

            I recently started climbing and it's the best activity I've ever done! It gives me a lot of confidence in myself when I conquer a wall which the week before I found too challenging or didn't have the courage to finish. It's also great for building my physical strength and getting out with friends to do something a little different in the city.
